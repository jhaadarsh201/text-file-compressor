code: Holds the current dictionary code while traversing the input data. It starts with a special Nil value to indicate no initial code.
codeBitsWidth: The width of the dictionary codes in bits. It starts with a predefined constant StartBits (likely the minimum code width, e.g., 9 bits).
Dictionary: Manages the mapping between sequences of bytes and their corresponding codes. It includes functions for adding, finding, and resetting entries.
BitStreamWriter: Handles writing compressed data into a dynamically growing memory buffer as bits.
